# inventoryUtility

# About

This is my first personal project for Boot.dev. I decided to make a program to make a biweekly task I have to do at work easier.

This project contains two tools:

1. mapFormatter - Takes a list of shortened order numbers and converts it from voicetexting-ese into a neat list.
2. stagedListGen - Takes order information to build and format a list for my biweekly email.
